Escrow
=========

A texting app, powered by Ruby on Rails and the Twilio API, that allows the user to write a text message, choose a date and time that they want to send it, and it will be sent at that date and time. Perfect for boutique hotels, doctors office's, people managing several employees, etc. A combination of CSS/Bootstrap was used for the design of the site, as well as specific media queries for the mobile version of the site (can be viewed on an iPhone 5). Mongo DB was used as the database.
